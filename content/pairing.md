In the long standing spirit of Recurse Center experimentation I'm starting a personal pairing experiment. I'm interested in spending an hour or two where you walk me through your project and we work on a feature together. Here are some things I've paired on in the past two weeks:

* Starting a toy Torrent meta search engine using BeautifulSoup and Elasticsearch (with [Gautham Goli](https://github.com/GauthamGoli)).
* Profiling and reducing memory usage in a Python project that stores large files in memcache (with [Indradhanush](https://indradhanush.github.io/)).
* Showing and explaining basic git usage.
* Writing C code to do math on wide integers without using assembly instructions.
* Doing some word related exercises in Python.
* Intercepting ICMP packets in Rust.
* Writing integration tests for a full-stack Javascript project.

Here's a paring wishlist:

* Generative art
* Fuzzing
* Systems programming
* Something you are excited about

The best time for me to pair is weekdays between **11am** and **7pm EDT**. If you are not in NYC you must have a connection that can handle real-time collaborative text editing and some sort of voice chat.

**I promise I will send you a response, even if it turns out we can't pair. If you are interested email me at [hi@kate.io](mailto:hi@kate.io) with a little about yourself and any projects you want to pair on.**

*The project cannot be commercial or your school work. I'm happy to try out programming languages that are new to me, but I'm only fluent in English.*
