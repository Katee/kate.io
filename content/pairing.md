In the long standing spirit of Recurse Center experimentation I'm running a personal pairing experiment. I'm interested in spending an hour or two where you walk me through your project, and we work on a feature together. Pairing works best for me on weekdays between **11am** and **8pm EDT**, but I can be flexible. **We can pair remotely** or in person if you are in NYC. These pairing sessions are **completely free**.

**If you are interested email me at [hi@kate.io](mailto:hi@kate.io) with a little about yourself and any projects you want to pair on. I promise I will send you a response.** If you don't have a project in mind email me anyways, we can look at a project of mine.

Recently I've paired on:

* A toy Torrent meta search engine using BeautifulSoup and Elasticsearch (with [Gautham Goli](https://github.com/GauthamGoli)).
* Profiling and reducing memory usage in a Python project that stores large files in memcache (with [Indradhanush](https://indradhanush.github.io/)).
* Integration tests for a Javascript project using React and Firebase.
* Intercepting ICMP packets in Rust.
* Some word related exercises in Python.
* C code to do calculations on wide integers without using the built-in operators.
* Explaining and demonstrating basic git usage.

I love to pair on things that are new to me, here is a wish list:

* Generative art
* Fuzzing
* Systems programming
* Something you are excited about

*The project must not be commercial or a school assignment. I'm happy to try out programming languages that are new to me, but I'm only fluent in English. If we pair remotely you must have a connection that can handle real-time collaborative text editing and voice chat.*
